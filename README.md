## Features
* Made with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) and can preview Composable.
* Can easily register UI components using a `DSL`, and group them.
* Supports [Android View](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View), [DataBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding), [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) and [Fragment](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments).

## Getting Started
### step1: Add the dependency.

`// TODO: write`

### step2: Register the UI component in the Catalog.

Just run `startKatalog` function in your application.

```kotlin
class MyApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        startKatalog {
            title = "My App Catalog"
            compose("UI Component") {
                Text(text = "Hello, World")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Can group by using `group` function.

```kotlin
startKatalog {
    title = "My App Catalog"
    
    group("Group 1") {
        compose("UI Component") {
            /* ... */
        }
    }

    group("Group 2") {
        /* ... */
    }
}
```

Group can also be assigned to a variable.

```kotlin
val group1 = group("Group 1") {
    /* ... */
}
val group2 = group("Group 2") {
    /* ... */
}
startKatalog {
    title = "My App Catalog"
    group(group1, group2)
}
```

### step3: Start Catalog Activity

Start KatalogActivity from your debug menu.

```kotlin
KatalogActivity.start(activity)
```
