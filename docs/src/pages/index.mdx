## Why Katalog?
Implementing UIs in the mobile app is becoming complex, and we need to be aware of visual omissions and degradation.
Katalog is the UI catalog library that can manage, organize, and preview UI components inspired by [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and [Playbook](https://github.com/playbook-ui/playbook-ios).

Katalog is enabled to build UIs independently from the domain/logic and it can easily play any UI state even hard-to-reach cases and edge cases.
Also, it is useful for facilitating UI components reuse by managing and previewing UIs.

Katalog will be a powerful driver of your development.

## Features of Katalog

<Preview
    imageUrl={useBaseUrl('/img/docs/start.png')}
    width={1080}
    height={2280} >

It is made with `Jetpack Compose` and you can preview `Composable`.
You can easily register and group UI components using the `DSL` , as shown below.

```kotlin
class MyApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        registerKatalog(
            title = "My App Catalog"
        ) {
            compose("UI Component") {
                Text(text = "Hello, World")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

</Preview>

In addition to [Composable](/docs/main/jetpack-compose), the following UI components are supported

* [Android View](/docs/main/android-view)
* [DataBinding / ViewBinding](/docs/main/binding)
* [Fragment](/docs/main/fragment)

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Android View" label="Android View" default>

```kotlin
view(
    name = "TextView"
) {
    TextView(context).apply {
        text = "Hello, World"
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="DataBinding / ViewBinding" label="DataBinding / ViewBinding">

```kotlin
binding(
    factory = SampleBinding::inflate,
    name = "Binding Sample"
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Fragment" label="Fragment">

```kotlin
fragment {
    SampleFragment()
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
