## Why using the UI Catalog?
When implementing complex UIs, you need to be aware of various things such as omissions and degradation.

The UI Catalog can be build UIs separately from the logic, so it is easy to reproduce hard-to-reach states and edge cases.
It will be useful for reuse UIs by organizing and managing UI components.

The UI Catalog will powerfully help for your development.

## Features of Katalog

    width={1080}
    height={2280} >

It is made with `Jetpack Compose` and you can preview `Composable`.
You can easily register and group UI components using the `DSL` , as shown below.

```kotlin
class MyApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        registerKatalog(
            title = "My App Catalog"
        ) {
            compose("UI Component") {
                Text(text = "Hello, World")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

</Preview>

In addition to [Composable](/docs/main/jetpack-compose), the following UI components are supported

* [Android View](/docs/main/android-view)
* [DataBinding / ViewBinding](/docs/main/binding)
* [Fragment](/docs/main/fragment)

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Android View" label="Android View" default>

```kotlin
view(
    name = "TextView"
) {
    TextView(context).apply {
        text = "Hello, World"
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="DataBinding / ViewBinding" label="DataBinding / ViewBinding">

```kotlin
binding(
    factory = SampleBinding::inflate,
    name = "Binding Sample"
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Fragment" label="Fragment">

```kotlin
fragment {
    SampleFragment()
}
```
